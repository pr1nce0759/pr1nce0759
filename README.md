👋 Hey there! I'm Aman Shaikh, a passionate technologist with a diverse background spanning Azure Platform and services, cybersecurity research, and game modding.

🛠️ In my current role, I specialize in leveraging the power of Azure to build robust and scalable solutions for a variety of projects. Whether it's architecting cloud infrastructure, implementing DevOps practices, or optimizing performance, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Azure technologies.

🔒 With a foundation in cybersecurity research, I bring a keen eye for identifying and mitigating potential risks and vulnerabilities in software and systems. My experience in this field has honed my ability to think like an attacker, enabling me to design more secure and resilient solutions.

🎮 When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can often find me tinkering with game mods. I enjoy exploring the creative possibilities of modding communities, whether it's adding new features, tweaking gameplay mechanics, or building entirely new experiences within my favorite games.

🌟 I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and gaming aficionados. Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate, share ideas, or just geek out over the latest tech trends and gaming adventures!
